abstract = {It is a growing concern that outcomes of neuroimaging studies often cannot be replicated. To counteract this, the magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging community has promoted acquisition standards and created data sharing platforms, based on a consensus on how to organize and share MR neuroimaging data. Here, we take a similar approach to positron emission tomography (PET) data. To facilitate comparison of findings across studies, we first recommend publication standards for tracer characteristics, image acquisition, image preprocessing, and outcome estimation for PET neuroimaging data. The co-authors of this paper, representing more than 25 PET centers worldwide, voted to classify information as mandatory, recommended, or optional. Second, we describe a framework to facilitate data archiving and data sharing within and across centers. Because of the high cost of PET neuroimaging studies, sample sizes tend to be small and relatively few sites worldwide have the required multidisciplinary expertise to properly conduct and analyze PET studies. Data sharing will make it easier to combine datasets from different centers to achieve larger sample sizes and stronger statistical power to test hypotheses. The combining of datasets from different centers may be enhanced by adoption of a common set of best practices in data acquisition and analysis.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter receptors support the propagation of signals in the human brain. How receptor systems are situated within macroscale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remains poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography scans in >1200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain 3-D normative atlas of 18 receptors and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems. We find that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncover a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we find both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical thinning patterns across 13 disorders. We replicate all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 N{\o}rgaard, Ganz, Svarer, Fisher, Churchill, Beliveau, Grady, Strother and Knudsen. Background: Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder characterized by seasonally occurring depression that often presents with atypical vegetative symptoms such as hypersomnia and carbohydrate craving. It has recently been shown that unlike healthy people, patients with SAD fail to globally downregulate their cerebral serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in winter, and that this effect seemed to be particularly pronounced in female S-carriers of the 5-HTTLPR genotype. The purpose of this study was to identify a 5-HTT brain network that accounts for the adaption to the environmental stressor of winter in females with the short 5-HTTLPR genotype, a specific subgroup previously reported to be at increased risk for developing SAD. Methods: Nineteen females, either S' carriers (L G - and S-carriers) without SAD (N = 13, mean age 23.6 ± 3.2 year, range 19-28) or S' carriers with SAD (N = 6, mean age 23.7 ± 2.4, range 21-26) were PET-scanned with [11C]DASB during both summer and winter seasons (asymptomatic and symptomatic phase, 38 scans in total) in randomized order, defined as a 12-week interval centered on summer or winter solstice. We used a multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach with NPAIRS split-half cross-validation, to identify and map a whole-brain pattern of 5-HTT levels that distinguished the brains of females without SAD from females suffering from SAD. Results: We identified a pattern of 5-HTT levels, distinguishing females with SAD from those without SAD; it included the right superior frontal gyrus, brainstem, globus pallidus (bilaterally) and the left hippocampus. Across seasons, female S' carriers without SAD showed nominally higher 5-HTT levels in these regions compared to female S' carriers with SAD, but the group difference was only significant in the winter. Female S' carriers with SAD, in turn, displayed robustly increased 5-HTT levels in the ventral striatum (bilaterally), right orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus (bilaterally), extending to the left supramarginal gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left postcentral gyrus during winter compared to female S' carriers without SAD. Limitations: The study is preliminary and limited by small sample size in the SAD group (N = 6). Conclusions: These findings provide novel exploratory evidence for a wintertime state-dependent difference in 5-HTT levels that may leave SAD females with the short 5-HTTLPR genotype more vulnerable to persistent stressors like winter. The affected brain regions comprise a distributed set of areas responsive to emotion, voluntary, and planned movement, executive function, and memory. The preliminary findings provide additional insight into the neurobiological components through which the anatomical distribution of serotonergic discrepancies between individuals genetically predisposed to SAD, but with different phenotypic presentations during the environmental stressor of winter, may constitute a potential biomarker for resilience against developing SAD.},

abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain and plays a key role in several brain functions and neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, epilepsy, and depression. The binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine receptor sites (BZR) located on GABAA receptors (GABAARs) potentiates the inhibitory effect of GABA leading to the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative effects used for treatment of those disorders. However, the function of GABAARs and the expression of BZR protein is determined by the GABAAR subunit stoichiometry (19 genes coding for individual subunits), and it remains to be established how the pentamer composition varies between brain regions and individuals. Here, we present a quantitative high-resolution in vivo atlas of the human brain BZRs, generated on the basis of [11C]flumazenil Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data. Next, based on autoradiography data, we transform the PET-generated atlas from binding values into BZR protein density. Finally, we examine the brain regional association with mRNA expression for the 19 subunits in the GABAAR, including an estimation of the minimally required expression of mRNA levels for each subunit to translate into BZR protein. This represents the first publicly available quantitative high-resolution in vivo atlas of the spatial distribution of BZR densities in the healthy human brain. The atlas provides a unique neuroscientific tool as well as novel insights into the association between mRNA expression for individual subunits in the GABAAR and the BZR density at each location in the brain.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter receptors modulate the signaling between neurons. Thus, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters play a key role in shaping brain function. Due to the lack of comprehensive neurotransmitter receptor/transporter density datasets, microarray gene expression is often used as a proxy for receptor densities. In the present report, we comprehensively test the expression-density association for a total of 27 neurotransmitter receptors, receptor binding-sites, and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems, using both PET and autoradiography imaging modalities. We find poor spatial correspondences between gene expression and density for all neurotransmitter receptors and transporters except four single-protein metabotropic receptors (5-HT1A, D2, CB1, and MOR). These expression-density associations are related to population variance and change across different classes of laminar differentiation. Altogether, we recommend using direct measures of receptor and transporter density when relating neurotransmitter systems to brain structure and function. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Migraine has been hypothesized to be a syndrome of chronic low serotonin (5-HT) levels, but investigations of brain 5-HT levels have given equivocal results. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT4 receptor as a proxy for brain 5-HT levels. Given that the 5-HT4 receptor is inversely related to brain 5-HT levels, we hypothesized that between attacks migraine patients would have higher 5-HT4 receptor binding compared to controls. Eighteen migraine patients without aura (migraine free >48 h), and 16 age- and sex-matched controls underwent PET scans after injection of [11C]SB207145, a specific 5-HT4 receptor radioligand. An investigator blinded to group calculated a neocortical mean [11C]SB207145 binding potential (BPND). Three migraine patients reported a migraine attack within 48 h after the scan and were excluded from the primary analysis. Comparing 15 migraine patients and 16 controls, we found that migraine patients have significantly lower neocortical 5-HT4 receptor binding than controls (0.60 ± 0.09 vs. 0.67 ± 0.05, p =.024), corrected for 5-HTTLPR genotype, sex and age. We found no association between 5-HT4 receptor binding and attack frequency, years with migraine or time since last migraine attack. Our finding of lower 5-HT4 receptor binding in migraine patients is suggestive of higher brain 5-HT levels. This is in contrast with the current belief that migraine is associated with low brain 5-HT levels. High brain 5-HT levels may represent a trait of the migraine brain or it could be a consequence of migraine attacks.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that the emergence and severity of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) symptoms in the winter is associated with an increase in cerebral serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) binding. Intriguingly, we also found that individuals resilient to SAD downregulate their cerebral SERT binding in the winter. In the present paper, we provide an analysis of the SERT- and 5-HT dynamics as indexed by 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) binding related to successful stress coping. We included 46 11C-DASB positron emission tomography (PET) scans (N = 23, 13 women, age: 26 ± 6 years) and 14 11C-SB207145 PET scans (7 participants, 3 women, age: 25 ± 3 years) from 23 SAD-resilient Danes. Data was collected longitudinally in summer and winter. We found that compared to the summer, raphe nuclei and global brain SERT binding decreased significantly in the winter (praphe = 0.003 and pglobal = 0.003) and the two measures were positively correlated across seasons (summer: R2 = 0.33, p =.004, winter: R2 = 0.24, p =.018). A voxel-based analysis revealed prominent changes in SERT in clusters covering both angular gyri (0.0005 < pcorrected < 0.0016), prefrontal cortices (0.00087 < pcorrected < 0.0039) and the posterior temporal and adjacent occipital cortices (0.0001 < pcorrected < 0.0066). We did not observe changes in 5-HT4R binding, suggesting that 5-HT levels remained stable across seasons. We conclude that resilience to SAD is associated with a global downregulation of SERT levels in winter which serves to keep 5-HT levels across seasons.},

abstract = {Background: The pathophysiology of migraine may involve dysfunction of serotonergic signaling. In particular, the 5-HT1B receptor is considered a key player due to the efficacy of 5-HT1B receptor agonists for treatment of migraine attacks. Aim: To examine the cerebral 5-HT1B receptor binding in interictal migraine patients without aura compared to controls. Methods: Eighteen migraine patients, who had been migraine free for >48 hours, and 16 controls were scanned after injection of the 5-HT 1B receptor specific radioligand [11C]AZ10419369 for quantification of cerebral 5-HT1B receptor binding. Patients who reported migraine <48 hours after the PET examination were excluded from the final analysis. We defined seven brain regions involved in pain modulation as regions of interest and applied a latent variable model (LVM) to assess the group effect on binding across these regions. Results: Our data support a model wherein group status predicts the latent variable (p = 0.038), with migraine patients having lower 5-HT1B receptor binding across regions compared to controls. Further, in a whole-brain voxel-based analysis, time since last migraine attack correlated positively with 5-HT1B receptor binding in the dorsal raphe and in the midbrain. Conclusion: We report here for the first time that migraine patients have low 5-HT1B receptor binding in pain modulating regions, reflecting decreased receptor density. This is either a primary constitutive trait of the migraine brain or secondary to repeated exposure to migraine attacks. We also provide indirect support for the dorsal raphe 5-HT1B receptors being temporarily downregulated during the migraine attack, presumably in response to higher cere-bral serotonin levels in the ictal phase.},

For quantification of PET data, researchers commonly apply different arrays of sequential data analytic methods (“preprocessing pipeline”), but it is often unknown how the choice of preprocessing affects the final outcome. Here, we use an available data set from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [11C]DASB-PET study as a case to evaluate how the choice of preprocessing affects the outcome of the study. We tested the impact of 384 commonly used preprocessing strategies on a previously reported positive association between the change from baseline in neocortical serotonin transporter binding determined with [11C]DASB-PET, and change in depressive symptoms, following a pharmacological sex hormone manipulation intervention in 30 women. The two preprocessing steps that were most critical for the outcome were motion correction and kinetic modeling of the dynamic PET data. We found that 36% of the applied preprocessing strategies replicated the originally reported finding (p < 0.05). For preprocessing strategies with motion correction, the replication percentage was 72%, whereas it was 0% for strategies without motion correction. In conclusion, the choice of preprocessing strategy can have a major impact on a study outcome.},

abstract = {Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important neuroimaging tool to quantify the distribution of specific molecules in the brain. The quantification is based on a series of individually designed data preprocessing steps (pipeline) and an optimal preprocessing strategy is per definition associated with less noise and improved statistical power, potentially allowing for more valid neurobiological interpretations. In spite of this, it is currently unclear how to design the best preprocessing pipeline and to what extent the choice of each preprocessing step in the pipeline minimizes subject-specific errors. To evaluate the impact of various preprocessing strategies, we systematically examined 384 different pipeline strategies in data from 30 healthy participants scanned twice with the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) radioligand [11C]DASB. Five commonly used preprocessing steps with two to four options were investigated: (1) motion correction (MC) (2) co-registration (3) delineation of volumes of interest (VOI's) (4) partial volume correction (PVC), and (5) kinetic modeling. To quantitatively compare and evaluate the impact of various preprocessing strategies, we used the performance metrics: test-retest bias, within- and between-subject variability, the intraclass-correlation coefficient, and global signal-to-noise ratio. We also performed a power analysis to estimate the required sample size to detect either a 5% or 10% difference in 5-HTT binding as a function of preprocessing pipeline. The results showed a complex downstream dependency between the various preprocessing steps on the performance metrics. The choice of MC had the most profound effect on 5-HTT binding, prior to the effects caused by PVC and kinetic modeling, and the effects differed across VOI's. Notably, we observed a negative bias in 5-HTT binding across test and retest in 98% of pipelines, ranging from 0 to 6% depending on the pipeline. Optimization of the performance metrics revealed a trade-off in within- and between-subject variability at the group-level with opposite effects (i.e. minimization of within-subject variability increased between-subject variability and vice versa). The sample size required to detect a given effect size was also compromised by the preprocessing strategy, resulting in up to 80% increases in sample size needed to detect a 5% difference in 5-HTT binding. This is the first study to systematically investigate and demonstrate the effect of choosing different preprocessing strategies on the outcome of dynamic PET studies. We provide a framework to show how optimal and maximally powered neuroimaging results can be obtained by choosing appropriate preprocessing strategies and we provide recommendations depending on the study design. In addition, the results contribute to a better understanding of methodological uncertainty and variability in preprocessing decisions for future group- and/or longitudinal PET studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has become a prominent tool to capture the spatiotemporal distribution of neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain. The outcome of a PET study can, however, potentially be obscured by suboptimal and/or inconsistent choices made in complex processing pipelines required to reach a quantitative estimate of radioligand binding. Variations in subject selection, experimental design, data acquisition, preprocessing, and statistical analysis may lead to different outcomes and neurobiological interpretations. We here review the approaches used in 105 original research articles published by 21 different PET centres, using the tracer [ 11 C]DASB for quantification of cerebral serotonin transporter binding, as an exemplary case. We highlight and quantify the impact of the remarkable variety of ways in which researchers are currently conducting their studies, while implicitly expecting generalizable results across research groups. Our review provides evidence that the foundation for a given choice of a preprocessing pipeline seems to be an overlooked aspect in modern PET neuroscience. Furthermore, we believe that a thorough testing of pipeline performance is necessary to produce reproducible research outcomes, avoiding biased results and allowing for better understanding of human brain function.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate and assess the correlation and the reproducibility of multiparametric imaging in head and neck cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients were included in this prospective scan-rescan study. All patients were scanned twice on an integrated Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance imaging scanner (PET/MR). Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were defined on T2-weighted MR images (GTVT2) and volumes of interest were defined on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and FDG PET (VOIDWI, VOIPET). Overlap between volumes was assessed as a percent-wise overlap. FDG uptake and diffusion were measured using standardized uptake value (SUV) and apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) and correlation was tested across and within patients and as a voxel-by-voxel analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were available for correlation analysis and 12 patients were available for assessment of tumor overlap. The median tumor overlap between VOIDWI and VOIPET was 82%( VOIDWI in VOIPET) and 62%( VOIPET in VOIDWI) on scan 1 and scan 2, respectively. Across patients, the correlation between SUV and ADC was weak and non-significant. However, in individual patients a weak but significant correlation was identified on a voxel-by-voxel basis. CONCLUSION: In multiparametric imaging with the integrated PET/MR, the VOIs from DWI and FDG PET were both within the target volume for radiotherapy and overlapped substantially although not completely. No correlation between FDG uptake and DWI could be found across patients, but within individual patients a statistically significant, but weak, voxel-by-voxel correlation was found. The findings suggest that information on glucose uptake and diffusion coefficient carries complementary information of interest which may be relevant for radiotherapy treatment planning.},

abstract = {Temporal memory plays a crucial role in organizing real- life events into meaningful segments. Previous research sug- gests that the clustering of temporally related information builds on the neural correlates of associative memory, including theta oscillations. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) provides a means of modulating theta oscillations within associative memory networks, possibly including hippocampal modulation when targeting the parietal cortex. Theta oscillations are not limited to a single frequency range, but instead, exhibit functional special- ization, with slow theta (3 Hz) implicated in short- term episodic memory formation and fast theta (8 Hz) involved in spatial navigation. Our study aimed to investigate the distinct effects of slow and fast theta stimulation on temporal memory. Participants encoded visual objects paired with frame color while receiving tACS stimulation at 3 Hz, 8 Hz, or sham targeting the left parietal cortex. The frame color would change after every eight objects, establishing a con- text boundary with each color change. Subsequently, participants performed a timeline task to assess temporal memory performance. Results showed that slow, but not fast, theta stimulation led to an enhancement in temporal accuracy (absolute temporal error) compared to sham tACS, in support of our main hypothesis. Under sham stimula- tion, participants consistently underestimated the temporal position of items presented further away from boundary, compared to those presented at boundary. This finding resembled temporal compression observed during event segmentation. Interestingly, fast, but not slow, theta stimulation reduced this temporal bias (rated position– actual position). This study represents the first tACS evidence for differential contributions of slow versus fast theta to tem- poral memory formation in humans. We speculate that parietal theta tACS may modulate the hippocampus and facil- itate temporal memory formation. Keywords:},
