Description
</summary>

The mental health system in Europe faces challenges, with extensive waiting times for diagnostic psychiatric appointments, and in Denmark, a national average waiting time of 92 weeks to see a specialist. 
We aim to develop AI algorithms for mental health screening, specifically targeting Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which affects up to 6.9% of the European population. The algorithms will help to reduce the waiting time for diagnosis and improve the overall efficiency of the mental health system.
The research project is based on a collaboration between three senior scientists from different disciplines — neuroscience, AI as well as medicine — as well as two collaborators from the field of ethics.

> The TRUSTMIND project is anchored at the Image section of the Department of Computer Science and led by Assc. Prof. Melanie Ganz-Benjaminsen.
