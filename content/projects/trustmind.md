The mental health system in Europe faces challenges, with extensive waiting times for diagnostic psychiatric appointments, and in Denmark, a national average waiting time of 92 weeks to see a specialist. 

We aim to develop AI algorithms for mental health screening, specifically targeting Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which affects up to 6.9% of the European population. The algorithms will help to reduce the waiting time for diagnosis and improve the overall efficiency of the mental health system.

The research project is based on a collaboration between three senior scientists from different disciplines—neuroscience, AI as well as medicine—as well as two collaborators from the field of ethics.

The TRUSTMIND project is anchored at the Image section of the Department of Computer Science and led by Assc. Prof. Melanie Ganz-Benjaminsen.
