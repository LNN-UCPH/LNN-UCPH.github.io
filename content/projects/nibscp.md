<p>
​NIBS-CP (NeuroImaging of Babies during Natural Sleep to Investigate Typical Development and Cerebral Palsy) is a brain research project at Hvidovre Hospital, supported by the Elsass Foundation. In NIBS-CP, we investigate the development of the brain and motor function in infants. The project has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees for the Capital Region of Denmark (H-24008782), and has also been reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency via the Knowledge Center for Data Reviews in the Capital Region of Denmark.

​The project investigates two groups of infants - typically developing infants and infants at risk of cerebral palsy. The infants at risk of cerebral palsy are recruited from Professor Christina Høi-Hansen's national CP-EDIT (Cerebral Palsy: Early Diagnosis and Intervention Trial) study at Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital. The typically developing infants (control participants) are recruited via the Danish center for Magentic Resonance Imaging (DRCMR) at Hvidovre Hospital, social media, mothers' groups, etc. Control participants must be born at term (> week 37) without birth complications and be free of neurological disease to participate in the project. In addition, you must reside in the Capital Region of Denmark or Region Zealand. The children will be followed over time with three visits between the ages of 3-24 months. The visits consist of motor and neurological examinations and MRI scans at Hvidovre Hospital.

The project will enable a mapping of typical and atypical brain development, as well as how brain development is connected to and predicts motor development in children. In addition, a Danish normative material of brain development in the 0-2 year age range will be established.
