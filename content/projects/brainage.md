Aging is associated with a wide range of molecular and structural changes throughout an individual's lifespan, resulting in the deterioration of physical abilities and increased risk of disease [1]–[3]. In the brain, aging results in cognitive decline [4] and predisposes to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [5]. Therefore, developing biomarkers capable of robustly capturing age-related biological changes is necessary to understand the pathophysiology of various disorders and potentially assess the effects of interventions that target aging [2], [6].
This project is a collaboration between the Data Analysis group at the [Neurobiology Research Unit (NRU)](https://nru.dk/index.php), and lead by the Group of [Pontus Plavén-Sigray at the Karolinska Institutet](https://sigray-lab.github.io/sigray_lab_website/). In particular, we aim to:

- Validate existing biomarkers of brain aging on large datasets, focusing on test-retest reliability and construct validity. Both are important and need to be established before application in clinical trials
- Develop new biomarkers of aging using machine learning and neuroimaging. Mainly, we are interested in whether brain imaging using positron emission tomography yields important information regarding aging.
